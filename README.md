# AutoKat
Andrew J. McGehee's Kattis submission client adapted for Windows.

[Original Repo](https://github.com/andrewjmcgehee/katti-automation)  


Setup
-----
 Python is required and python3 must be linked (run `python3` to check).


 1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/alexlwn123/AutoKat`.  
 2. Login to kattis and download or copy your .kattisrc file from `https://icpc.kattis.com/download/kattisrc`.
 3. Move your .kattisrc file into the same directory as `AutoKat.py`.  



Usage
------
- Name solutions `[problem id].[extention]`.

- To post a solution run the following command:  
 `> python3 autokat.py -p [problem id]`    
 This will search your current directory for a file with the same name.




Notes
------------

 - I only implemented a fix for **Submission ie. post: `-p`** because that's only what I use. I commented the sections involving the `get` and `run` options, as they don't work on windows.   

 - All solution files must use the following naming format: `[problem id].xxx`

 - To post a solution run the following command:  
   `> python3 autokat.py -p [problem id]`    
   This will search your current directory for a file with the same name.
 
 - The script automatically detects the language being used in the submission. It supports C++, Java, Python2, Python3, and Common Lisp. 

 - I'd suggest setting up aliases on cmd. Here is a [Tutorial](https://superuser.com/a/1134468) on how to set up permanent doskeys (aliases) on cmd. I have `autokat` aliased to `python3 C:\path\to\file\autokat.py $*`, which allows me to run autokat with `> autokat -p [problem id]` from any directory.
